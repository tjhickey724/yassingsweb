<h2>Early Life</h2>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-8">
<p>
Yas grew up in a modest home in Tokyo. Her mother noticed her interest in music at an early age and she started taking classical piano lessons. By Junior High School she had her own piano and was an enthusiastic student of the classics (and also had a thing for Paul McCartney like most of her classmates!)
</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
Yas studied at Kunitachi Music College and graduated with a degree in Early Childhood Music Education in Dalcroze. Immediately after college she moved to the US and settled in Boston where she was trained in Jazz arranging at Berklee School of Music and also became certified in Dalcroze and Orff.
</p>
<h2>
The Music Circuit
</h2>
<p>
For the next ten years she lived as a working Jazz musician, singing and playing Jazz standards in both solo gigs and in small combos. Yas worked in many of the best known hotels and restaurants in the 80s including the Bay Tower Room and several snazzy hotels downtown!

<h2>Raising a family and teaching children</h2>
<p>
As the 80's turned into the 90's, Yas started raising a family and transitioned from a 6 night/week Jazz musician to a dedicated and enthusiastic music educator. She is usually teaching in a half dozen different schools and is accomplished as a general music teacher at the Cambridge Montessori School, a classical piano teacher at Powers Music School, and Dalcroze Eurhythmics teacher at Longy School of Music and at the New England Conservatory.
</p>


<h2>Back to Jazz</h2>
<p>
Now that her youngest children are both teenagers and her oldest is a New Orleans traditional Jazz musician, Yas is starting to perform again. She accompanies several singers and is a frequent member of several Jazz combos. Her main group is the Boston Impromptu.
